# SingingAssistant
A Sinatra server for local Alexa commands ðŸŽ¤

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kylegrantlucas/readingit.git && cd SingingAssistant
```

```bash
bundle install
```

## Usage

You will need to connect the server externally, personally I do this using Nginx as a reverse proxy.
However this may be a little complicated to setup and is outside the scope of this document, so I recommend you use Ngrok.
Ngrok is a utility that allows you to externally port any local port to a domain.

## Plugins

I have built several plugins for 3rd party services:
